        <p> This is <strong>fifty words</strong> about me, nothing special. Just a smooth, crisp, and clean fifty words that will fill this paragraph to the required amount of words in the alluded tag space. I am definitely not trying to stretch the utilization of words utilized to fill the fifty words taking me to hit <em>fifty five</em>.</p>
        <p> Seriously though, my name is Chris and Iâ€™m from Ottawa. I am a former personal trainer/ coach and I have some experience managing my own business. I love nature and often camp, fish, kayak and explore the world during the summer. I desire to see the world. I have visited a few countries so far hoping to grow the number again since COVID had us locked up for two years. I have been to the US, Italy, Ireland, and Croatia and after saving up with my girlfriend; backpacking in Ireland/ Croatia has me itching since restrictions have been lifted to get back out there after saving up again.</p>
